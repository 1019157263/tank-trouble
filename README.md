# tank-trouble
An online multiplayer clone of the wonderful game tank trouble, using JavaScript and Python using only Flask and WebSocket as external libraries.
This is mostly a project for me to learn more JS and WebSocket, but it seems like we might actually get a playable game out of it...

This is still in early development.
